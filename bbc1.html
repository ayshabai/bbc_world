<h3 style="margin-left: 175px;">Whalers in Iceland have killed what appears to be a blue whale, one of the largest<br> creatures left on the planet.</h3>

<p style="margin-left: 175px;font-size: 18px;">Photographic evidence from campaigners opposed to whaling show a large animal <br>
  being butchered for export.<br>
  <br>

  Several experts have concluded from these pictures that it's a juvenile male blue,<br>
  a species that hasn't been deliberately killed since 1978.<br><br>



  The whaling company involved say they are confident that the animal is a hybrid<br>
  between a blue and fin whale.<br><br>



  DNA testing will be needed to confirm the whale's true identity.<br><br><p>

    </div><br><br>

    <h3 style="margin-left: 175px;">Why does the species matter?</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 175px;font-size: 18px;">
      The key reason for interest in the species is to determine whether this killing is <br>legal or not under Icelandic law.
      <br><br>
      Weighing as much as 200 tonnes and stretching up to 30 metres, blue whales were<br> hunted to the brink by commercial whalers from many countries including the UK<br> from the 1940s to the 1960s when they became a protected stock under the <span style="font-weight: bold; ">International <br>Whaling Commission.</span> That means that all countries, including Iceland agreed not to kill <br>the creatures. 
    </p>
    <img src="capture1.jpg" style="margin-left: 175px;"><br><br>
    <p style="margin-left: 175px;font-size: 18px;">
      It's different for fin whales. While there is an international moratorium on killing all whales,<br> Iceland doesn't agree that fin whales are threatened and gives permits for their hunting.<br><br>

      Hybrids between fin and blue whales are a grey area, say specialists. A hybrid allows the<br> whalers to say they simply made a mistake.<br><br>

      "If this is a blue whale, it would be illegal and a breach and there could be fines and perhaps<br> the company might lose their licence to hunt whales," said Arne Feuerhahn, from campaign <br> group Hard to Port, which documented the latest killing.<br><br></p>

      <h3 style="margin-left: 175px;">What do experts think?</h3>
      <p style="margin-left: 175px;font-size: 18px;">
        From the photographic evidence, most seem to be of the view that it is a blue whale.<br><br>

        "We cannot confirm 100%," said Arne Feuerhahn.<br><br>

        "We have consulted a lot of international experts, most think that it is a juvenile male blue <br>whale but there also has been some doubts with some believing that it could be a hybrid <br>between a blue and a fin whale." <br><br>

        <img src="capture2.jpg" ><br><br>
        Others were more definite.<br><br>

        "From the photos, it has all the characteristics of a blue whale," Dr Phillip Clapham, from <br> the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Alaska Fisheries Science <br>Centre, said in a statement.<br><br>

        "Given that, notably the coloration pattern, there is almost no possibility that an experienced <br>observer would have misidentified it as anything else at sea."</p>
        <h3 style="margin-left: 175px;">What do the whalers say?</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 175px;font-size: 18px;">
          The company involved is certain that the animal it has killed is not a blue whale but a hybrid.<br><br>

          "I am absolutely confident that it's a hybrid," said Kristján Loftsson who runs Hvalur hf.<br><br>

          "To mistake a blue whale for a fin whale is impossible, this whale has all the characterisations<br> of a fin whale in the ocean. There are a lot of blue whales off the Iceland coast, when we see<br> the blows and sail to it, and we realise it is a blue and then we leave it and go and look for fin <br>whales."
        </p>
        <h3 style="margin-left: 175px;">What have the Icelandic government said?</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 175px;font-size: 18px;">
          Kristján Thor Juliusson, Iceland's Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, said: "While initial <br>information suggests that the animal in question was not a blue whale, we take these reports<br> seriously and the relevant authorities are investigating this matter with all urgency.<br><br>

          "At present, Icelandic authorities are not in a position to confirm the species, although initial <br> information from the directorate of fisheries in Iceland suggests the animal caught is not likely <br> to be a blue whale but rather a hybrid of a fin whale and a blue whale.<br><br>

          Campaigners believe that whether it's a blue or a hybrid won't matter that much in the long term <br> as the overall impression in their view is negative.<br><br>

          "These images leave people around the world speechless - thousands come to Iceland to see <br>these animals in the wild and there is just one company who keep this industry alive in Iceland.<br> It really shines a bad light on Iceland's reputation internationally," said campaigner Arne <br>Feuerhahn.<br><br></p>
          <h3 style="margin-left: 175px;">Will DNA testing be definitive?</h3>
          <p style="margin-left: 175px;font-size: 18px;">
            Yes it's likely that it will be. But there are doubts among campaigners that this will <br>happen swiftly.<br><br>

            "We've been contacting the Icelandic authorities and requested samples," said Arne<br> Feuerhahn.<br><br>

            "But it looks right now that they are not really bothered as they have said it could be fall or<br> winter before they get the results of DNA tests."<br><br>

            The Icelandic government say they are not dragging their feet on this issue..<br><br>

            "This will only be confirmed once a DNA analysis has been concluded, a process that is <br>being expedited due to the nature of these reports," said Minister Kristján Thor Juliusson,<br><br>
            <h3 style="margin-left: 175px;">Are hybrid blue whales common?</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 175px;font-size: 18px;">
              Specialists believe that hybrids are not very common in the waters off Iceland. <br><br>
              <img src="capture3.jpg" ><br><br>
              "Since 1983, they've only recorded five of them," said Astrid Fuchs from the charity, <br><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Whale and Dolphin Conservation</span>.<br><br>

              "Four of them have been killed by whalers and one is a very beloved whale watching object<br> and is still alive - they are very rare," she told BBC News.<br><br></p>
              <h3 style="margin-left: 175px;">What will happen to the whale meat?</h3>
              <p style="margin-left: 175px;font-size: 18px;">
                Iceland sells almost all of its whale meat to Japan one of a handful of countries that <br>reject the international consensus to protect whales. However, if this whale is a blue then<br> this meat can't be legally shipped anywhere.<br><br>

                <img src="capture4.jpg" ><br><br>
                If it turns out to be a hybrid whale, then it is possible that it could be sold in Iceland. <br>However, under the international regulations that govern animal trading, it is the status of the <br>hybrid parents that matter - so if it has blue whale parentage, the Japanese market would be <br>closed.<br><br></p>
                <h3 style="margin-left: 175px;">What are the implications for Icelandic whaling?</h3>
                <p style="margin-left: 175px;font-size: 18px;">
                  Kristján Loftsson's company has already captured and killed 22 whales including this <br>recent and most controversial one.<br><br>

                  If it turns out to be a hybrid, then it is likely there won't be major repercussions for the<br> whalers.<br><br>

                  Mr Loftsson says he is being targeted by campaigners and there is nothing unusual about <br>the recent killing.<br><br>

                  "This is nothing new to us, we have had at least five in previous years with similar <br>characteristics and DNA analysis shows a completely different profile from a fin whale and<br> that has been described as a hybrid of a blue and a fin," he told BBC News.<br><br>

                  Campaigners, though, believe it could be the beginning of the end.<br><br>

                  "We hope it might be the nail in the coffin of Icelandic whaling," said Astrid Fuchs from WDC<br> (Whale and Dolphin Conservation).<br><br>

                  "It confirms what scientists have been saying for years, whaling can't be regulated - it <br>is always a bit out of control, they are going out there but they don't know what they are shooting. <br>If this is a blue it would drive home the message that you can't regulate this."<br><br> </p>
